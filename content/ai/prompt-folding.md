A technique for compressing or condensing long prompts while preserving their essential information and intent. This involves identifying the core instructions and context needed for the AI model to perform the task effectively, while removing redundant or less critical elements. Prompt folding is particularly useful when working with models that have limited context windows, as it allows for more efficient use of available space while maintaining the quality of the AI's response. The process often involves iterative refinement to find the optimal balance between brevity and comprehensiveness.
