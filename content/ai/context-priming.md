**Priming** is a psychological phenomenon where a previous stimulus influences our subsequent thinking - for example, after seeing luxury brands, we're more willing to spend more money.

**Context priming in AI-assisted programming** uses this principle by providing relevant context and code examples to a language model.

In practice, we provide samples of existing code, define programming language and conventions. For example, instead of "write a sorting function," we write: "In Python with type hints, write a function that sorts a list of numbers in ascending order" and add an example of a similar function. The model then generates code that matches our standards.
