In the context of AI, research refers to the systematic investigation and analysis capabilities that AI models can perform to gather, synthesize, and analyze information from various sources. This includes the ability to formulate research questions, identify relevant information sources, extract key insights, and present findings in a structured manner. AI research capabilities can involve literature review, data analysis, trend identification, and hypothesis generation. Modern AI systems can assist in academic research, market analysis, competitive intelligence, and fact-checking by processing large amounts of information quickly and identifying patterns or connections that might be missed in manual research processes.
