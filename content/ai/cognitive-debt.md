The accumulated reduction in human cognitive capabilities and critical thinking skills that can result from over-reliance on AI systems for tasks that previously required mental effort and learning. Similar to technical debt in software development, cognitive debt represents the long-term cost of taking shortcuts through AI assistance without maintaining underlying competencies. This phenomenon can manifest as reduced ability to perform tasks independently, weakened problem-solving skills, or loss of domain expertise when AI tools become unavailable. Managing cognitive debt involves maintaining a balance between leveraging AI efficiency and preserving human cognitive abilities through deliberate practice and learning. Understanding this concept is crucial for responsible AI adoption in education, professional development, and personal growth contexts.
