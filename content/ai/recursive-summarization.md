A technique for processing and summarizing large documents or datasets by breaking them into smaller chunks, summarizing each chunk individually, and then recursively summarizing the summaries until reaching a final, comprehensive summary. This hierarchical approach enables the processing of documents that exceed the context window limitations of AI models while maintaining important information across all levels of detail. The method creates a tree-like structure of summaries, where each level captures information at different granularities. Recursive summarization is particularly useful for long-form content analysis, research paper synthesis, and extracting key insights from extensive documentation. The technique helps preserve both high-level themes and important details that might be lost in traditional single-pass summarization approaches.
