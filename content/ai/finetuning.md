The process of taking a pre-trained AI model and further training it on a specific dataset or for a particular task to improve its performance in that domain. Finetuning allows models to specialize while retaining their general capabilities, making them more effective for specific use cases, industries, or applications. This approach is more efficient than training from scratch, requiring less data and computational resources while achieving better results for targeted tasks. Finetuning can involve adjusting model weights, adding task-specific layers, or modifying the training objective. It's commonly used for domain adaptation, style transfer, and creating specialized assistants with particular expertise or behavioral characteristics.
