A technique that involves connecting multiple prompts in sequence, where the output of one prompt becomes the input or context for the next prompt in the chain. This approach enables the creation of complex workflows that can handle multi-step tasks, such as research, analysis, and content creation pipelines. Each prompt in the chain is designed to perform a specific function, such as gathering information, processing data, or refining output. Chain of prompts is particularly useful for tasks that require multiple stages of reasoning or processing, allowing for better quality control and the ability to optimize each step independently while maintaining overall workflow coherence.
