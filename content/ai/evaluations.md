Systematic methods for assessing AI model performance, capabilities, and limitations across various tasks and domains. Evaluations encompass both automated benchmarks and human assessments to measure accuracy, safety, alignment, and other important characteristics. These assessments include standardized tests for reasoning, knowledge, coding abilities, and safety considerations. Effective evaluation frameworks are crucial for understanding model capabilities, comparing different AI systems, identifying areas for improvement, and ensuring responsible deployment. Modern evaluation approaches also consider factors like bias, fairness, robustness, and real-world applicability, going beyond simple accuracy metrics to provide comprehensive assessments of AI system behavior.
