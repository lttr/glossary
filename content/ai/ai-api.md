An interface for programmatic access to AI services. It allows developers to integrate artificial intelligence capabilities into their own applications without needing to create their own models.

Many tools and application plugins allow (or require) the use of a custom access token for such AI APIs. The advantage is that one model can be used across multiple applications, or multiple models can be used within a single application. Pricing is also not flat-rate but directly corresponds to usage.
