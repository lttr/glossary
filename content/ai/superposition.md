A phenomenon in neural networks where models represent more features than they have neurons by using overlapping, distributed representations. This allows AI models to efficiently encode vast amounts of information in limited dimensional space by having individual neurons participate in representing multiple concepts simultaneously. Superposition enables models to compress knowledge efficiently but can make interpretation challenging since features are not cleanly separated. Understanding superposition is crucial for mechanistic interpretability research, as it helps explain how models can store and process such rich information despite apparent dimensional constraints. This concept has implications for model compression, feature extraction, and our understanding of how artificial neural networks organize and utilize their representational capacity.
