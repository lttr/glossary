A prompting technique that encourages AI models to break down complex problems into step-by-step reasoning processes, making their thought process explicit and transparent. By instructing the model to "think step by step" or providing examples of step-by-step reasoning, this approach significantly improves performance on tasks requiring logical reasoning, mathematical problem-solving, and complex analysis. Chain of thought prompting not only enhances accuracy but also makes the AI's reasoning process more interpretable and debuggable. This technique is particularly valuable for educational applications, where understanding the reasoning process is as important as getting the correct answer.
