A prompting technique that provides the AI model with a small number of examples (typically 2-10) to demonstrate the desired task or output format before asking it to perform a similar task. This approach leverages the model's in-context learning capabilities, allowing it to understand patterns and requirements from the provided examples without requiring additional training. Few-shot prompting is particularly effective for tasks that require specific formatting, style, or reasoning patterns. The quality and relevance of the examples significantly impact the model's performance, making careful selection of representative examples crucial for optimal results.
