A technique where you provide the beginning of the AI model's response to guide its output in a specific direction or format. By starting the response with certain words, phrases, or structure, you can influence the model to continue in the desired style, tone, or format. This approach is particularly useful for ensuring consistent formatting, steering the conversation toward specific topics, or maintaining a particular voice or perspective. Prefilling can also help with reducing unwanted behaviors or ensuring the model follows specific templates, making it a powerful tool for applications requiring standardized outputs or specific communication patterns.
