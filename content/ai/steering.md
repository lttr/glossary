Techniques for directing and controlling AI model behavior and outputs during inference without retraining the model. Steering involves using various methods to influence the model's responses, including activation steering, representation engineering, and guided generation techniques. These approaches allow for real-time adjustment of model behavior, enabling fine-grained control over aspects like tone, style, factuality, and adherence to specific guidelines. Steering is particularly important for ensuring AI systems behave appropriately across different contexts and user needs while maintaining safety and alignment. Modern steering techniques can help prevent harmful outputs, ensure consistency with organizational values, and adapt model behavior to specific use cases or user preferences.
