Dense vector representations of text, images, or other data that capture semantic meaning and relationships in a high-dimensional space. Embeddings enable AI models to understand and work with concepts by converting them into numerical vectors where similar concepts are positioned closer together in the vector space. These representations are fundamental to many AI applications, including search, recommendation systems, and similarity matching. Modern embedding models can capture complex semantic relationships, enabling tasks like finding similar documents, clustering related content, and supporting retrieval-augmented generation systems. The quality of embeddings directly impacts the performance of downstream applications that rely on semantic understanding.
