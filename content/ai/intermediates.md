The intermediate representations, activations, or hidden states that occur within AI models during processing, between the input and final output. These intermediate states capture the model's internal computations and reasoning steps as information flows through different layers and components. Analyzing intermediates is crucial for understanding how models process information, make decisions, and arrive at their outputs. This analysis can reveal the model's internal reasoning process, identify where errors occur, and provide insights into model behavior. Intermediate representations are also valuable for debugging, interpretability research, and developing techniques for model improvement. In some applications, intermediates can be extracted and used as features for downstream tasks or as checkpoints in multi-stage processing pipelines.
