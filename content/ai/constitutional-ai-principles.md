Constitutional AI is about giving AI systems a set of written principles to follow. Think of it like a code of ethics that guides how AI behaves and gets developed. What's interesting is that most major AI companies have ended up with pretty similar principles, even though they compete with each other.

## What Everyone Agrees On

Most AI companies seem to agree on a few key ideas. First, AI should help humans rather than replace or harm them. There's also a big focus on safety - companies want to test things thoroughly before releasing them rather than moving fast and breaking things.

Transparency matters too. Companies generally believe AI should be explainable and that they should be open about their principles and processes. And there's widespread agreement that AI shouldn't be biased or discriminatory.

## Why the Convergence?

The fact that Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, Anthropic and others have such similar principles probably isn't just marketing speak. It suggests these ideas reflect real technical and social challenges that everyone in the field recognizes.

Most companies use some form of written constitution or charter, they engage with outside experts and policymakers, they update their approaches as technology evolves, and they generally prioritize being careful over being first to market.
