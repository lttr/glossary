A technique combining information retrieval with text generation to improve accuracy and relevance. The model uses an external knowledge base from which it retrieves information at runtime based on the input query.

RAG enables models to access up-to-date information beyond their training data, making them more factual and capable of handling domain-specific queries with current information.
