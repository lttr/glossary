A capability that allows AI models to engage in prolonged, deliberate reasoning before providing a response, similar to how humans might think through complex problems. This involves the model working through multiple steps, considering various angles, and refining its understanding before arriving at a conclusion. Extended thinking is particularly valuable for complex problem-solving, strategic planning, and situations requiring careful analysis of trade-offs. The process often involves internal dialogue, hypothesis testing, and iterative refinement of ideas. This approach can lead to more thoughtful, nuanced, and accurate responses, especially for tasks that benefit from thorough consideration rather than immediate answers.
