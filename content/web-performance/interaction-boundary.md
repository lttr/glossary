- Frontend framework used to be interactive
- Now nothing is interactive by default (server component without JS)
- Now we have to define _interaction boundaries_ ourselves

Mentioned by Theo that the term was used in conversation with Dan Abramov in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/live/EDCLPOa5wq0?feature=share&t=10138)
